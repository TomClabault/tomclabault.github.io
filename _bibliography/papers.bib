  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Sampling a light to shade from the pool of all lights, e.g., using next event estimation, is a nontrivial task. Sampling must be computationally efficient, must select lights contributing significantly to the shaded point, and must produce low noise while introducing little or no bias. Typically, the light pool is preprocessed to create a data structure that accelerates sampling queries; this may be complex to implement, build, and update.",

abstract = {Path-traced global illumination of scenes with complex lighting remains particularly challenging at real-time framerates. Reservoir-based resampling methods for light sampling allow for significant noise reduction at the cost of very few shadow rays per pixel. However, current image-space approaches to reservoir reuse do not scale to sample lighting at further bounces, as is required for efficiently evaluating indirect illumination. We present a novel approach to performing reservoir-based spatiotemporal importance resampling in world space, allowing for efficient light sampling at arbitrary vertices along the eye path. Our approach caches the reservoirs of the path vertices into the cells of a hash grid built entirely on the GPU. Such a structure allows for stochastic reuse of neighboring reservoirs across space and time for efficient spatiotemporal reservoir resampling at any point in space.},

abstract = {In this paper, we show that applying a linear transformation---represented by a 3 x 3 matrix---to the direction vectors of a spherical distribution yields another spherical distribution, for which we derive a closed-form expression. With this idea, we can use any spherical distribution as a base shape to create a new family of spherical distributions with parametric roughness, elliptic anisotropy and skewness. If the original distribution has an analytic expression, normalization, integration over spherical polygons, and importance sampling, then these properties are inherited by the linearly transformed distributions.By choosing a clamped cosine for the original distribution we obtain a family of distributions, which we call Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs), that provide a good approximation to physically based BRDFs and that can be analytically integrated over arbitrary spherical polygons. We show how to use these properties in a realtime polygonal-light shading application. Our technique is robust, fast, accurate and simple to implement.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a ratio estimator of the direct-illumination equation that allows us to combine analytic illumination techniques with stochastic raytraced shadows while maintaining correctness. Our main contribution is to show that the shadowed illumination can be split into the product of the unshadowed illumination and the illumination-weighted shadow. These terms can be computed separately - possibly using different techniques - without affecting the exactness of the final result given by their product.This formulation broadens the utility of analytic illumination techniques to raytracing applications, where they were hitherto avoided because they did not incorporate shadows. We use such methods to obtain sharp and noise-free shading in the unshadowed-illumination image and we compute the weighted-shadow image with stochastic raytracing. The advantage of restricting stochastic evaluation to the weighted-shadow image is that the final result exhibits noise only in the shadows. Furthermore, we denoise shadows separately from illumination so that even aggressive denoising only overblurs shadows, while high-frequency shading details (textures, normal maps, etc.) are preserved.},

abstract = {With the advent of real-time ray tracing, there is an increasing interest in GPU-friendly importance sampling techniques. We present such methods to sample convex polygonal lights approximately proportional to diffuse and specular BRDFs times the cosine term. For diffuse surfaces, we sample the polygons proportional to projected solid angle. Our algorithm partitions the polygon suitably and employs inverse function sampling for each part. Inversion of the distribution function is challenging. Using algebraic geometry, we develop a special iterative procedure and an initialization scheme. Together, they achieve high accuracy in all possible situations with only two iterations. Our implementation is numerically stable and fast. For specular BRDFs, this method enables us to sample the polygon proportional to a linearly transformed cosine. We combine these diffuse and specular sampling strategies through novel variants of optimal multiple importance sampling. Our techniques render direct lighting from Lambertian polygonal lights with almost no variance outside of penumbrae and support shadows and textured emission. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for solid angle sampling of polygons. It is faster and more stable than existing methods.},
